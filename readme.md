# Diamond

## A 24 keys handwired split keyboard.

Diamond is a handwired board originally designed by me but heavily inspired by the [Rommana](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/Rommana) and using the switch holders of the [Dactyl Cygnus](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards).
- It contains 24 keys only, in the format 1333+2.
- It should be handwired, ideally using single switch PCBs.
- The MCU, reset button and on/off switch goes in the base, below a cover used to hide them.
- These components should be mounted upside down, under this cover.
- The cables for column and rows will pass through 3 holes in the cover and can be tightened in the end of assembling to make them less visible in the final build.
