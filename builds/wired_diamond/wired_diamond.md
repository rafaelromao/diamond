## Wired Diamond
### A 24 keys handwired split keyboard.

### Build Details

Diamond is a handwired board originally designed by me but heavily inspired by the [Rommana](https://github.com/AlaaSaadAbdo/Rommana) and using the switch holders of the [Dactyl Cygnus](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards).

Wired Diamond is a variant of this keyboard that uses two Xiao RP2040 connected using USB-C and using the experimental [Wired Split PR](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2080).

For more information about how this wired split PR works for this MCU, check this other repo: https://github.com/rafaelromao/wired-zmk-config.
